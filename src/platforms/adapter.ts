/**
 * PlatformAdapter — the seam between the platform-agnostic MCPL layer
 * (ChannelManager, ContextProvider) and the platform-specific client.
 *
 * One implementer today (Zulip), but the seam is the documented shape a
 * platform plugs into, and it costs nothing to keep. An adapter owns one
 * platform connection and is responsible for:
 *   - discovering channels and describing them (ChannelDescriptor)
 *   - delivering outgoing publishes (with thread routing where supported)
 *   - fetching recent history for context/beforeInference injections
 *   - streaming real-time incoming messages (self-filtered)
 *
 * Everything that crosses this seam names a channel by its key (see
 * channel-key.ts); channel ids are made only where something leaves for the
 * host, and descriptors carry the id the host is told. The rollback record
 * is the exception: `onSent` and `deleteMessage` carry the channel id.
