/**
 * ZulipMcplServer — the JSON-RPC main loop over an `McplConnection`.
 *
 * Speaks plain MCP to any client (initialize, tools/*, resources/*) and MCPL
 * 0.5 to hosts that advertise `experimental.mcpl` in their initialize
 * capabilities: featureSets/update (the §5.3 policy exchange), mcpl/manifest,
 * channels/*, push/event, and context/beforeInference.
 *
 * Delivery model (per message the adapter hands over):
 *   - channel open by the host  → channels/incoming (batched)
 *   - channel closed, addressed → push/event with the closed-channel origin,
 *                                  carrying the missed-ambient tally so the
 *                                  host can show what staying out has cost
 *   - channel closed, ambient   → dropped and tallied (`channel_missed`)
 *
 * Every forward the host accepts advances a persisted per-channel
 * watermark; what is on its way to the host, or was offered and not
 * accepted, holds the watermark below it (the undelivered floor). What the
 * host has not accepted is offered again — by a
 * live replay from history once the host answers, by the catch-up on
 * the next connection, or by the gap recovery a Zulip event-queue expiry
 * triggers. Nothing is lost to a later acceptance.
 *
 * One connection at a time. `serve()` resolves when the peer disconnects;
 * every connection starts from a fresh grant, registration and catch-up.
